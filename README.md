## **Pixar Films SQL Challenge**

## Project Description

This is an **SQL** challenge for beginners, intermediate and professional buiness analysts and data engineers.

Daily, I will be solving at least 2 questions for different use cases. The aim is to make it publicly available for learners or people who went on break to refresh their memory on writing **SQL** logical querries.

## **How to Use**

The files are separated into 3 categories for each level. Preferably, open according to your level, pick a question and study the query, then write your answer in another approach, or make it more professional to show you understand the question.

Then make a **pull request**, let's keep advancing the repository for others to benefit.

_Good luck_
